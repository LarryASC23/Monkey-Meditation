    <p>This livestream provides music to help ease nerves and possible anxiety. Don't worry about needing to touch your phone to change tracks, since this is
        a livestream, it is all done automatically. These beats can be used for so many things like studying, sleeping, or just simply trying to rest the mind.

      <h2>Yume Utsutsu - Lamp</h2>

      <p>This song is a personal pick of mine from one of my favorite bands called "Lamp". They are based in Japan, but do not let that scare you from listening to
        their music. The soft tones of the vocalists along with the 70s inspired intrumentals make for amazing and relaxing music to just enjoy.

      <p> Lofi is a newer genre of music in which its only appeal is to not really be enjoyed but only listened to. Many use it to study or sleep to as the name
        of the stream would imply. This is a livestream which has been live for more than a year so the music here will surely never run out.
